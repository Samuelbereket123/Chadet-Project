                CHADET is a prominent charitable organization in Ethiopia dedicated to promoting the welfare and protection of children facing challenging circumstances.
                Established during the height of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, CHADET focuses on educating communities about the epidemic's impact on children and families,
                fostering awareness and support. The organization initially launched its first project in the bustling Merkato area of Addis Ababa, a hub for street-connected and vulnerable children.
                Through training and deploying peer educators, CHADET effectively delivers crucial information and support to affected families, empowering them to navigate their challenges.
                Over the years, CHADET has expanded its reach, now operating in thirteen districts across the Amhara and Oromiya regions, as well as in Addis Ababa. The organization has developed five field offices
                and three service delivery centers, enhancing its capacity to address the needs of marginalized children. With a commitment to improving lives, CHADET continues to make significant strides in advocating for and supporting
                the most vulnerable populations in Ethiopia.
